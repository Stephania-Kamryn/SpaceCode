# Name: Stephania Kamryn R
# Roll No: 125EE0093
# Topic: Cosmos-Exploring space through code
A personal space-themed portfolio showcasing my curiosity about space science, satellite motion, and astronomy, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, with interactive UI elements and mission deep-dives.

# Features

*Interactive Space UI
*Dark / Light theme toggle using Tailwind’s dark mode
*Animated starfield background using math.random()
*Responsive design
*learn more button to opn detailed modal views

# Related Project showcase

Satellite Orbit Tracker (Python + Matplotlib)
Clicking the project opens:Description,Github repo link,Screenshot preview of the animation

 It is a Python-based satellite orbit visualization tool that:

*Uses TLE (Two-Line Element) data
*Computes satellite positions and velocities
*Animates real-time orbital motion using Matplotlib

# This project helped me understand

*Coordinate transformations
*Scientific visualization
*Visual Effects & Animations
*generated starfield using JavaScript
*Nebula animation (Work In Progress)

The nebula blur-based background is currently under refinement.
The implementation exists in the codebase and will be finalized in a future update.

This reflects my iterative development approach — building features progressively while ensuring code clarity.


# Tech Stack
HTML5
Tailwind CSS (CDN)
JavaScript (Vanilla)
Python + Matplotlib (Satellite project)

# Learning Resources
Bro Code (YouTube) — for foundational HTML and CSS concepts
learnt required vanilla js from chatgpt
ChatGPT — used as a debugging assistant for clarifying conceptual doubts and required js
Browser DevTools — for inspecting elements, debugging JavaScript, and testing UI behavior



# Future Improvements (Probably Post-Deadline)

Complete animated nebula background
edit-fixed it

Add Earth rotation / orbit animation

Mission search using public space APIs (NASA / ISRO)

Convert project into a multi-page portfolio

Deploy via GitHub Pages

# Why I Built This

I am deeply interested in space science and satellite systems.
This project is my attempt to:
*Learn by building
*Explain space missions visually
*Bridge engineering + storytelling

# Contact

If you’d like to discuss space, satellites, or software projects — I’d love to connect!

# Note to Reviewers

This project is actively evolving.
The current submission represents a functional, concept-complete version, with ongoing visual enhancements planned.
